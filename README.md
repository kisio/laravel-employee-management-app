# laravel-employee-management-app

A full-fledged employee management system using Laravel and Filament PHP. This project encompasses various features essential for managing employees effectively. The system includes user management, allowing administrators to create, update, and delete user accounts. It also includes authentication functionality, where users can securely log in using their email and password. To enhance security, the system locks a user's account for five minutes after three consecutive failed login attempts.
# 
The app  incorporates an employee management module, providing a comprehensive list of employees with search and filtering options based on name and department. Administrators can create, update, and delete employee records as needed. The system also includes management for additional entities such as country, state, city, and department, allowing for seamless organization and categorization of employees.
# 
To enhance usability, the system offers a dashboard within the admin area, providing an overview of employee statistics, including the count of employees and categorizing them by country. The dashboard is customizable, with custom widgets showcasing specific employee data based on country or department.
# 
This project also entails the creation of an API endpoint to retrieve a list of all employees ordered by their last names. This endpoint provides a convenient way to access employee data programmatically.
